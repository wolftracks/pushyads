<p>PushyAds.com (“PushyAds” or “we”) is a DBA of HiTek Ad Systems, LLC and operates PushyAds.com, which is an advertising service that allows Members to submit
 advertisements, and place widgets with advertisements on their websites.  The services offered by PushyAds include any PushyAds-branded URL (the "PushyAds Website"),
 the PushyAds widget (PUSHY!&#8482), the PushyAds Network of widgets on websites (PUSHY!&#8482 Network), Ad Submission software, and other features, content,
 or applications offered from time to time by PushyAds in connection with PushyAds’ business (collectively, the " PushyAds Services").  The PushyAds Services
 are hosted in the United States.

<p>This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the PushyAds Services.  By using the PushyAds Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the PushyAds Website, including through a mobile device, or otherwise use the PushyAds Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with PushyAds).  The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the PushyAds Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement. Please read this Agreement and save it.  If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to follow all applicable laws, you should leave the PushyAds Website and discontinue use of the PushyAds Services immediately.  If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and/or make use of the PushyAds Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process.

<p>This Agreement includes PushyAds’ policy for acceptable use of the PushyAds Services and Content (as defined in Section 6.1 below) posted on or through the PushyAds Services and your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the PushyAds Services and Content posted on or through the PushyAds Services.
