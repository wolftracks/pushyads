Hi %firstname%,

Our attempt to Chrarge Your MONTHLY Subscription Renewal Fee,
due on %due_date%, has FAILED for the following reason.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DATE             : %date%
TIME             : %time%
PRODUCT          : %product%

If you need to update your credit card number or card expiration date,
please do the following:

     1. Sign in to your back office at http://pushyads.com
     2. Click on the REPORTS tab
     3. Click the STATUS tab on the REPORTS page.
     4. Make sure your Credit Card Information is entered correctly in
        the Section titled: Purchase Information

We will retry this charge for up to a total of 5 days.

Our final attempt will occur on %last_attempt%.

But here's the REALLY BAD NEWS %firstname%!

After the 5th attempt to charge your credit card, if it is unsuccessful,
your account will be downgraded to VIP and your ad privileges will be
lost.

WORSE THAN THAT, the system will delete all of your ads. So when you
upgrade later, you'll need to set them up all over again. Additionally,
all the viral activity you laid the foundation for will be lost.

So, it's extremely important that you do whatever you need to do in
order to resolve the matter with your bank as soon as you can.

Please handle this matter as quickly as possible, %firstname%, so we
can make sure that your account and your business activities resume
without interruption.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best Regards,
PushyAds Administration
