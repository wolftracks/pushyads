So sorry %firstname%,

But PUSHY! had to decline your ad.

     Product Name: %product_name%

Hey, I'm just the messenger so don't get mad at me. The following reason was given
for the decline:

      %reason%

We'll be adding a feature that will enable you to correct the problem with your ads,
right from inside your backoffice. But for now, we just need to decline them if they
don't pass the muster.

Go ahead and resubmit an ad that doesn't have one of the problems listed above.
If you have questions, please take a look at our FAQ, matching the related issues.
Otherwise, submit a question in our Support page.
