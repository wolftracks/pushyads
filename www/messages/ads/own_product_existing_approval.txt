Yay %firstname%,

Your request to have your product listed inside PUSHY!'s illustrious list of Affiliate
Offers has been approved. What's so great about this? Well, every cotton pickin
PUSHY! member on the planet has the opportunity to select your product from the
list and advertise it as their own throughout his Network.


      Product Name: %product_name%


All I can say is, YEE HAW!

Well, actually, I have a little bit more to say. Make sure you maintain your affiliate signup
URL. Every member who selects your product in the "Affiliate Offers" list on MY Ads
tab will be asked for their affiliate URL advertising your product. If they don't have one,
they will be given your affiliate signup page to become an affiliate.

If, for any reason you change your affiliate signup URL, or you close your affiliate
program, you need to let us know immediately. Fair enough?

Super deal, %firstname%. If you ever have any questions, need any help, just let us know.
Remember, there's a whole truck load of answers over on the FAQ under the Support
tab. Or, just submit us your question. Now, let's go Get PUSHY!

The very best,
