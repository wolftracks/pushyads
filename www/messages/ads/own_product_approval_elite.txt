MESSAGE
Great ad %firstname%,

At least PUSHY! thinks so. He just approved your ad listed below.

     Product Name: %product_name%
     Submission Date: %submit_date%

It will begin to run on the PUSHY! Network very soon, so get ready for some traffic.

You can go into your PUSHY! backoffice under MY ADS at any time to make changes
to your ad by clicking on the EDIT icon to the right of your product ad name. Updates
to the following will require PUSHY!'s appoval again, but your ad will continue to run
in the Network. If changes are approved, then they will take effect immediately.

     Product Name
     Product Title
     Product Description

Updates to the following parts of your ad will NOT require approval:

     Categories
     Product Sales URL
     Product Image


IMPORTANT NEXT STEP:  Pushy needs to know how you wish him to market this ad for you.
From your Approved Products list, simply check the appropriate box to indicate how you
would like market this ad and click the Update button.

If you want to upload more ads, remember, as an ELITE member, you can submit 4
ads, along with a product image for each.

OK, I better stop, or this is going to turn into a book, and PUSHY! might get mad at
me for talking too much. If you have any more questions, take a look at the FAQ by
clicking on the Support tab inside your backoffice.
