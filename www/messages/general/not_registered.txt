MESSAGE
Hi %firstname%,

On %signupdate%, you signed up to get more information on PUSHY Technlogy
so you could start generating viral targeted traffic to your website.

THE PROBLEM is that you didn't finish your registration process. You still
need to create a password so you can login to your backoffice and get all
your goodies.

Here's what you need to do... Just click on this link and you can finish
up the registration. Just scroll through the information, and make sure
you click on one of the links at the bottom of the page.

   %confirmation_link%

Then there's one more page to scroll through before you get to the page
where you'll need to create your password. And that's all there is to it.
See you inside!

Here's to Getting PUSHY!, %firstname%

The very best,

Mark
PUSHY!'s right hand man
