MESSAGE
Hi %firstname%,

I'm starting to think you're ignoring me ;-)

Listen, I don't mean to keep bugging you. But I have to believe you were serious when
you signed up to get more information on PUSHY Technologies at http://pushyads.com.
Remember? You wanted to generate targeted viral traffic to your website.

The problem is you didn't finish the registration process by simply clicking on the
confirmation link in the email with the subject heading,

     "%firstname%  Confirm your subscription"

If you didn't get that email, go ahead and go back to

     http://pushyads.com

Then scroll to the bottom of the page and fill out the form again. Look for another email
with the same Subject heading as above, then click on the confirmation link.

See you inside %firstname%. I'm looking forward to getting you the information.

All the best,

Mark
PUSHY!'s right hand man,
