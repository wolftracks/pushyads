  <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 Technology is the gold. And those who seize the opportunity of first-mover

<p>We will be adding over $500 worth of products and services for BETA testers, and even more for PRO, and ELITE members over the next 30 days. 
  As with all pre-launches, more will be added each day, with more announces coming.

        To get a full grasp (if that's even possible) of the vast reach that this new technology has, make it a point to watch every video on the front and backends of PushyAds (then, watch 
        them over again - you'll be amazed at how much more you pick up the second time).

        <p>In short, <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 Technology is a synergy of numerous viral marketing 
          components which replicate your marketing message by means of recognizing activity associated with your actions on the Internet. 

        <p>Your marketing message (the virus) is exponentially replicated (spread) to audiences (other organisms) who have the same interests as those you associate with your products. 
          This is all done automatically through our proprietary software, developed to perpetuate the virus (your marketing message), based on several elements programmed into it, and 
          which you initiate.

        <p>There are several factors that determine how fast and how far your virus (marketing message) spreads: 

          <ul>
            <li>Your membership level 
            <li>How many members you refer 
            <li>How many widgets on your web pages 
            <li>How many widgets on your referral's web pages 
            <li>How many hits to widgets on your web pages
            <li>How many hits to widgets on your referrals web pages
            <li>How many Network layers of referrals you have with activity
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>When the proprietary <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 algorithm detects activity in any of these areas, it
          seeks, sorts, and selects audiences for your product ads in direct proportion to your actions. Whether the activity is directly associated with YOUR actions, or the actions of YOUR 
          referral's actions, you benefit. The more activity generated from your referrals, the more "automated" 
          <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px"> becomes in spreading your virus.

        <p><img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/widget-150.png" height=120 style="float: left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0">
          The end result is a viral traffic stampede, that once started, becomes an automated snowball, gaining more and more momentum from efforts you implemented long time ago.

        <p>
          In contrast with all other types of advertising, marketing, or traffic generation, <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482
          only charges you one flat monthly fee (instead of per hit, per click, per anything). The flat fees of $47 and $97 are based on ACCESS to a certain number of viral marketing components.
          These pricepoints will rise in time, as more members join the Network, when realizing no other traffic method even comes close to comparison in price, quality, and ROI.

        <p>How much traffic is generated is determined completely on your product category, your activity (explained above), and your membership level, which determines your access to the 
          components <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 uses to spread your virus (marketing message).

        In a word, <b>Take Agressive Action</b>! OK, so that's 3 words. There is a proverb that goes, "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all your might." There has never been a 
        time where that is more appropriate than <b>RIGHT NOW</b>!

          To be more specific, focus on the your "<b>3 Main Objectives</b>" highlighted above (Refer members, Install 
          <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482, and Upload ads). It's just that simple. 
          Do it <b>FAST</b>, and do it <b>FURIOUS</b>! The market is wide open, and the plucking is ripe. 

        <p>Millions of Internet Marketers (anyone who advertises anything on the Internet) are looking for efficient, cost effective ways to generate targeted traffic. They're tired of all the 
          restrictions, competition, and complexity of Google Adwords, CPA networks, and high-priced, low quality lead generators clogging up the Internet.

        <p>The time has never been better for a new technology to come out, enabling business owners to reach their audience, without spending an arm, a leg, and their first born.

        <p>The key to capitalizing on <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 Technology sooner, rather than later, is to
          focus on the key determining factors that will create a viral traffic stampede for your products, and generate a landslide of income from the 
          <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 business opportunity

        <p><img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushyman-sh.png" height=190 style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 15px">
          Those factors are explained in the "<img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 Technology in a Nutshell" above. Once 
          you understand this, then you'll understand the power behind your "<b>3 Main Objectives</b>".

        <p>Lastly, VIP members only get a "test run", and it's for 30 days. VIP members do NOT get access to any viral traffic components. So if you are at all serious about taking full advantage
          of your timing and positioning at the front of this new technology, <a href=javascript:membership_plan()><b>upgrade</b></a> your membership at least to a PRO. Words to the wise 
          is always sufficient.

Mark Gilbert & Tim Wolf are cofounders of <b>Pushy Ads</b>. They have over 12 years of online experience working together. They both cofounded <b>AutoProspector.com</b> in 1999. In just their second year in business, they grossed over $5 million in sales. For the last 11 years they have generated millions of leads for hundreds of busineses and tens of thousands of affiliates in the mortgage, debt, legal, communications, network marketing, and a number of other industries.

<p><img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tim-sm.jpg"  style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px ">

Before this, they both had approximately 5 years of success in the Network Marketing industry, building multiple downline organizations for several companies (one as large as 5,500 distributors within their first 4 months). This was the foundation of the <b>AutoProspector</b> when they found an enormous need for a reliable marketing system that could generate hundreds of thousands of highly qualified leads for their distributors.</p>

<p>Generating high quality business opportunity prospects from an online lead generation system that could deliver leads within seconds after the inquiry was submitted, then distribute them to hundreds of individuals in the same campaign without sending the same lead out twice, had not yet been done in the industry.</p>

<p>It was the <b>AutoProspector</b> lead generation and realtime distribution system that was responsible for making hundreds of Prepaid Legal associates very wealthy during 2001 and 2002, setting the standard for online lead generation systems to follow. The <b>AutoProspector</b> system became well known for its quality, reliability, and consistency in the lead generation industry.</p>

<p>Mark has over 32 years experience in sales, marketing, consulting, has built and developed several businesses, two of which he is currently President & CEO in. Tim has over 33 years experience in programming software, with his last position in corporate America as lead architect for a multi-billion dollar, multi-national computer hardware and software company. Together, they live, eat, and breathe on the cutting edge of technology, and now want to have fun <b>Gettin</b> <img src="http://pds1106.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pushy14.png" style="vertical-align: -1px">&#8482 <b> ;-)</b>
