<p style="margin-top: 30px">Thirty months after their launch on July 4, 1996 they had amassed over 30 million active members. Twenty million of their users joined within
a 12 month period of time, tripling their size by the end of 1998. By then, the signup rates were totaling more than 150,000 per day, and more than 1 million per week.

<p>In the same way viruses replicate themselves by infiltrating millions of other organisms, Hotmail found a way to spread their marketing message to millions of people
through billions of emails (carrier agents).

   The result was an automatic & exponential response, which grew like wild fire over night. This powerful phenomenon became widely known as "<b>Viral Marketing</b>".

    <li>you don't have enough Traffic,</li>
    <li>your Traffic isn't converting high enough, or</li>
    <li>you aren't monetizing the Traffic you have (as much as you could be)</li>

<div align=center class="bold darkred Verdana size18"  style="margin:30px">What if you could harness 7 powerful Viral Marketing components
  <br>in your marketing strategy with the simple push of a button?

<p>In fact, let's go one step further and ask a nagging question that you're dying to know the answer to:

<div align=center class="bold darkred Verdana size18" style="margin:30px">What if this same Push Button technology enabled you to spread
  <br>your Marketing message to Millions of TARGETED prospects?
</div>

<p>In other words, what if there was technology that enabled you to get your product, service, or opportunity in front of millions of people who actually <b>WANTED</b>,
and in fact <b>NEEDED</b> your product, service, or opportunity?

<div align=center class="bold darkred Verdana size18" style="margin:30px">...and it all happened automatically, while you were sleeping,
  <br>on vacation, or spending time having fun with your family?
</div>

<p>Sound too good to be true? That's what Hotmail thought 3 years after they launched, when Microsoft reportedly paid them over $400 million for their brilliant viral
software system. And just like all new technologies, those who jump on them first, benefit the most.

<p>OK, so you want more proof than that?

<p>P.S The PUSHY Network is still in its infancy, growing by leaps and bounds every day. What could be but a trickle of targeted traffic one day, could be a literal stampede of traffic the next. Those who get in early, will experience a greater portion of that traffic stampede, as cloning of the viral affects increase.

<p>WHY? Because just like a virus replicates itself exponentially, building greater and greater momentum as it spreads itself to others, time increases the size of its exposure. It's one of those laws of the universe, neither you nor I have any power over. Trust me. It's like gravity. It just works!
